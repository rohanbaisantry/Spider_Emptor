# Spider_Emptor  Description: For the following site: https://www.federalreserve.gov/start-job-search.htm create a spider that can be executed from command line, takes an input, returns all items and can accept the following arguments: 1) No argument 2) Keyword 3) Job category   Example: $ scrapy crawl fed_reserve_jobs -a keywords=”python” -a category=”Security”  Requirements:  1) Python3 : https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/ 2) scrapy : https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/index.html 3) selenium : https://www.seleniumhq.org/ 4) chromedriver : https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads ( CI have included it in the github repo) 5) chrome browser :  https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwqsHWBRDsARIsALPWMEP8-46FmPDLE9gBiYsTppV9xIV1Btf0DetnKEcKTY9KiwxMei08d0QaArEeEALw_wcB  How to run: 1) install latest Chrome Browser 2) install python3 and the modules required: scrapy and selenium 3) download ChromeDriver and make the path correct so that no error comes. ( SEE NOTE[1] BELOW | P.S: it should work automatically. ) 4) once you have extracted the downloadable files from the github repo, open the pyton prompt in the  location: tutorials\spiders 5) run the spider using " scrapy crawl fed_reserve_jobs *...* "  Note[1]:  I have already taken care of the path by providing the chromedriver in the repo itself. if there still is an error for the path:  A)  remove all instances of chrome_path in job_search.py and perform the below step of adding the path to the environment variable: The Selenium client bindings tries to locate the geckodriver executable from the system PATH. You will need to add the directory containing the executable to the system path. Adding the path to the chromedriver.exe: 1) On Unix systems you can do the following to append it to your system’s search path, if you’re using a bash-compatible shell: "export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/directory/of/executable/downloaded/in/previous/step" 2) On Windows you will need to update the Path system variable to add the full directory path to the executable geckodriver manually or command line(don't forget to restart your system after adding executable geckodriver into system PATH to take effect). The principle is the same as on Unix.  B) You can also edit the job_search.py file and put the path of the chrome driver in the global variable "chrome_path"  Note[2]: The output finally scraped is printed and also stored in a text file in the same location.
